- `fwritescan.v`  
  Documents the scan state in binary, representing all flip-flop bits during the simulation.

- `valuetree_decl.v`  
  Declares the word-level register representation for the processor.

- `valuetree_Q_id.v`  
  Documents the ID number for each word-level register, providing a unique identifier for each register.

- `valuetree_Q.v`  
  At each negative edge of the clock, this file documents the value of each word-level register, capturing the state at each cycle.
