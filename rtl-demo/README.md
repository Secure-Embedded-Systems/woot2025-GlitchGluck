## Folder Descriptions (inside `rtl-demo/`)

- `software/`  
  Contains the software applications used to exercise the processor during simulation (e.g., test programs that trigger specific behaviors).

- `hdl/`  
  Includes the RTL design files of the target processor core used for this walkthrough.

- `fault-free/`  
  Holds the fault-free simulation setup. This directory documents the scan state data and illustrates how the Dynamic State Transition Graph (DSTG) is constructed from a clean execution trace.
