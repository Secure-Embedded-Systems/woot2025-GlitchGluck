## File Descriptions 

This folder evaluates the system behavior under correct and incorrect PIN entry conditions using simulation and DSTG analysis.

- `pin5-correct-pin-sim/`  
  Includes the simulation data for the correct PIN entry scenario.

- `pin5-correct-pin-dstg/`  
  Contains the Dynamic State Transition Graph (DSTG) results for the correct PIN entry.

- `pin5-incorrect-pin-sim/`  
  Includes the simulation data for the incorrect PIN entry scenario.

- `pin5-incorrect-pin-dstg/`  
  Contains the DSTG results for the incorrect PIN entry.

- `pin5-incorrect-pin-fis/`  
  Documents the Fault Injection State (FIS) data derived from the incorrect PIN experiment.

- `pin5-incorrect-pin-fit/`  
  Stores the Fault Injection Time (FIT) data, identifying the critical time point for fault injection under incorrect PIN input.
