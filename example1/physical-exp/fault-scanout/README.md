## File Descriptions

This directory contains scan-out results collected from the chip during physical experiments. Each file corresponds to a scan-out dump under a different glitch width, allowing comparison of hardware behavior under varying fault injection conditions.

### Physical Experiment Output (`fault-scanout/`)

- `map_sout_1dot6ns.txt`  
- `map_sout_2dot7ns.txt`  
- `map_sout_5ns.txt`  
- `map_sout_6dot1ns.txt`  
- `map_sout_10dot7ns.txt`  

Each file contains scan-out data collected at a specific glitch width (e.g., `1.6ns`, `2.7ns`, etc.). These results are used to evaluate the impact of fault injection under different timing conditions and compare the outcomes with fault-free simulation data.
