## File Descriptions 

We use Python3 to parse the VCD.

- `cycle21_D.rpt`  
  Parsed from the VCD file, this report captures the logic propagation arrival times for all D (input) signals at cycle 21.

- `cycle22_Q.rpt`  
  Parsed from the VCD file, this report captures the logic propagation arrival times for all Q (output) signals at cycle 22.
